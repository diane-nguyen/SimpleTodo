## Notes

One challange I had while creating this app was working with the auto-layout. I had trouble getting the recyclerView to lay infront of
the editText. While running the simulator, tapping on the editText field did not pull up the keyboard. I fixed this by fixing the margins and 
constraints of the recyclerView.
